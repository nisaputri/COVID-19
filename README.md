# COVID-19

This project is for INST 447.

From the beginning of 2020, many people have been infected with the coronavirus. 
Many people around the world want to know when this global pandemic will finally end because of how deadly the virus is believed to be. 
The pandemicâ€™s long-expected end will enable people to go back to living their normal lives. 
The number of confirmed coronavirus cases had been drastically increasing and there was no vaccine that could prevent it until early this year. 
However, there is still limited accurate information showing whether or not these vaccine distributions prevent the contraction of coronavirus or the number of new deaths by state. 
Through our research, we want to determine if the vaccine has been effective in decreasing the number of COVID-19 cases. 
This project will also discover the impact of COVID-19 cases after vaccines have been released in California and Texas. 
Our team wants to focus on these two states because these are the most populous states in the U.S. and each implemented different approaches in handling the COVID-19 pandemic.
